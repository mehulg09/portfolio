## Scientific Computing

### [Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Method](https://github.com/mehulg772/Mehul_portfolio/blob/main/Project_Codes/RandomWalk-MCMC-Fit.ipynb)
* A powerful model predicting any function's parameters or minimum points, curve fitting, and other potential uses in areas of statistical physics.

### [Numerical Differentiation](https://github.com/mehulg772/Mehul_portfolio/blob/main/Project_Codes/Numerical-Diff.ipynb)
* Three methods of increasing sophistication to estimate the derivative of a mathematical function. Also looking into how to choose the parameters of these methods to get accurate results, testing algorithm and exploring errors.

### [Numerical Integration](https://github.com/mehulg772/Mehul_portfolio/blob/main/Project_Codes/Numerical-Int.ipynb)
* Numerical integration methods, starting with the simple Trapezoid and Simpsonâ€™s rules, and moving on to the more sophisticated *Gaussian quadrature*.

### [Matrices, Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues](https://github.com/mehulg772/Mehul_portfolio/blob/main/Project_Codes/EigenVecVal.ipynb)
* Exploring matrices and their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Application to real-world case (ecology example), and solving one physics problem.
